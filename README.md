# Parallel Programming Intro for Physics People

I am, unfortunately, not a professional physicist.  I am a computational scientist or even (I hate to admit) a computer scientist.

But my passion is physics.   My degrees say chemistry but if you look at what I actually did in Graduate School, it was physics.   So while I am not a physicist, I am a member of a community I'll call "Physics People".   Physics defines the lens through which we view the world.   It clouds how we think about science and gives us a unique perspective on computing.

In this repository, you'll find materials to support a course on parallel computing specifically tuned to the needs of physics people.  It emphasizes OpenMP since that's the best place to start when learning parallel computing.  Over time, however, it will grow to include MPI, SYCL, PyOMP, Modin and other approach to parallel computing that physics people use.
