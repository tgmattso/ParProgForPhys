# Exercises to support an MPI hands-on course 

These are exercises to support a hands-on tutorial that introduces MPI to programmers.  MPI is a complex 
programming model.  This course touches on the core concepts behind MPI and the foundational
message passing infrastructure at its core.  This focus, however, means that we cover MPI 1.X
and leave off many of the great additions found in latter versions of MPI.

For now, these materials include the following hands-on exercises:
* pi: A numerical integration program.  This demonstrates the important bulk synchronous pattern in MPI.
* ring: A message passing program that passes message around a ring of processes.
* heat-eqn-sea: The simplest stencil code I could find to introduce geometric decomposition 
* transpose: Matrix transposition to explore how we work with distributed arrays. 

These exercises are a good way to get started with MPI, but I need a follow-on layer of exercises to cover 
the key features of the later versions of MPI.  In particular, I need to cover one-sided communication, mixing
MPI and multithreading, MPI and GPU programming, and MPI data structures.   Hoepfully this will all happen in 
the next year or so.
